# Typechecker Implementation Notes

> Status: v0.8.1 — elaboration support added (METEL-152): `check_graph` now threads `names.symbols` through `check_impl` → `construct_program` → `ConstructCtx` so that `construct_impl_decl` can populate `TypedImplBlock::aspect_id`.
>
> Status: v0.10.0 (in progress) — `Bound{polarity, aspect, assoc_bindings}` replaces bare `TypeExpr` in `GenericParam.bounds`/`WhereClause.constraints` (issue #233); `ImplBlock` gained `polarity`/`generics`/`where_clause`/`assoc_type_defs`; `AspectDecl` gained `assoc_types`; `TypeExpr::Projection` added for `T::AssocType`. See "Polymorphic Function Bodies" below for how impl-block-own-generics and generic type-argument recovery from runtime values (issue #267, ADR-0043) fit into construction-at-call-time.

## Theory Background

### Type Variables and InferType

During inference, types may be partially unknown. **Concrete types** (`Type` enum) are fully resolved: `Int`, `String`, `fun(Int) -> String`. **Inference types** (`InferType` enum) may contain type variables — placeholders that get unified with concrete types as more information becomes available:

```
?t0, ?t1, ?t2   — type variables (generated fresh for each unknown)
fun(?t0) -> ?t1 — an InferType containing type variables
```

Type variables satisfy an **occurs check**: `?t0` cannot be unified with `Array(?t0)`, which would create an infinite type.

### Unification

Unification makes two types equal by binding type variables:

```
unify(Int, Int)                        → ok, already equal
unify(?t0, Int)                        → ok, bind ?t0 = Int
unify(?t0, ?t1)                        → ok, bind ?t0 = ?t1
unify(Int, String)                     → error, incompatible
unify(fun(?t0) -> ?t0, fun(Int) -> Int) → ok, bind ?t0 = Int
unify(?t0, Array(?t0))                 → error, occurs check
```

### Substitution and Constraints

A **substitution** is a map from type variables to types (`?t0 → Int`, `?t1 → String`). Applying a substitution replaces all variables in a type with their bindings.

Rather than unifying types immediately as the AST is walked, the inference system collects **constraints** (equality relations between `InferType`s, each tagged with a source span) and solves them in batch. Batch solving handles complex interdependencies and produces better error messages.

### Let-Polymorphism and Type Schemes

A **type scheme** is a type with universally quantified variables: `∀α. α → α` (the identity function — works with any type). In code:

```rust
pub struct TypeScheme {
    pub quantified_vars: Vec<TypeVar>,
    pub ty: InferType,
}
```

When `let id = fun(x) { x }` is inferred:
1. Infer the body — parameter `x` gets fresh variable `?t0`, function type is `fun(?t0) -> ?t0`
2. **Generalize**: identify free type variables not shared with the outer environment; `?t0` is free → scheme `∀?t0. fun(?t0) -> ?t0`
3. Bind `id` to this scheme in `poly_env`

When `id` is **used**, the scheme is **instantiated** with fresh type variables — each call site gets an independent copy:

```
id(42)      → instantiate to fun(?t1) -> ?t1, unify ?t1 = Int  → id(42) : Int
id("hello") → instantiate to fun(?t2) -> ?t2, unify ?t2 = String → id("hello") : String
```

### The Generalization Boundary: Why `env_fvs` Matters

Generalization must only quantify type variables that are *truly local* to the function. If a variable is shared with the outer scope, quantifying it is unsound.

```metel
fun f(x) {
    let g = fun(y) { x };   // g's type: fun(?t1) -> ?t0 where ?t0 is x's type
}
```

`?t1` is local to `g` — safe to quantify. `?t0` is shared with `f`'s scope — quantifying it would let different calls to `g` return different types, but `x` has one concrete type per call to `f`. The typechecker snapshots the environment's free variables (`env_fvs`) before entering the function body and only quantifies variables absent from that set:

```
fun_ty   = fun(?t1) -> ?t0
env_fvs  = {?t0}                          ← x's type is already in scope
scheme   = ∀?t1. fun(?t1) -> ?t0          ← ?t0 left free, not quantified
```

The snapshot is taken before pushing the function's parameter scope — the right moment, capturing what the surrounding context has already committed.

### Never Type

`InferType::Never` (the bottom type `!`) unifies with any type. Diverging expressions — `return`, `break`, `continue`, and infinite `loop` with no reachable `break` — produce `Never`. This lets the constraint solver treat dead branches as compatible with any expected type.

### Rank-1 Limitation

The HM algorithm infers types at rank 1: `∀` only at the outermost level. Higher-rank polymorphism (e.g. a function that accepts a polymorphic function as an argument) requires decidability-breaking extensions and is not supported. The practical consequence: function arguments are unified as monotypes; passing a polymorphic function as an argument works only if the call site knows the concrete instantiation.

---

## Pre-Pass

Four pre-inference steps run before Pass 1:

1. `build_registry` (via `TypeDefinitionRegistry`) — registers types, aspects, and impls. It first calls `populate_schemes_from_embedded_core` to derive schemes for all `std::core` declarations (including `print`/`println`/`assert` with their aspect bounds, and `String::len` as a derived method entry), then calls `register_program_decls` for the user module. The old hand-maintained `register_builtins` step no longer exists — every stdlib item is derived from the embedded `core.mtl` source (ADR-0039).
2. `projections::check` — walks type-bearing annotations and bounds against the completed registry. It reports unresolved type and aspect names (and malformed record projections) before inference can turn them into stand-in types and emit a misleading unification error. Its scope carries generic parameters, valid `Self` positions, and block-local nominal declarations.
3. `build_overload_table` — groups same-name `fun` declarations into overload sets; assigns each definition a process-unique `SymbolId` from the `OVERLOAD_SYM_START` range. Overloaded names are not registered in the scheme env and are resolved by exact-match candidate selection in Pass 1 (ADR-0038).
4. `hoist_fun_decls` — walks top-level non-overloaded `FunDecl`s and pre-registers each with a fresh type variable in both `ctx.mono_env` and `ctx.poly_env`. Enables forward references, mutual recursion, and shadowing of `std::core` names. Native decls are hoisted with bounds derived from their annotated parameter types.

`hoist_fun_decls` is also called at block entry in `infer_block`, so nested functions support forward references within their block.

Struct and enum declarations follow **lexical scope rules** matching Rust's model:

- `build_registry` registers only top-level `struct`/`enum` declarations. These are globally visible for the entire compilation unit.
- Struct/enum declarations inside function bodies (or any nested block) are registered at block entry by `infer_block` using `TypeDefinitionRegistry::push_struct_scope` / `register_struct_fields` / `pop_struct_scope`. On scope exit, all names registered in that scope are removed from the registry.
- `construct_block` in Pass 2 mirrors this: it pushes a new struct scope, builds concrete field types from the substitution, and pops on exit.
- A locally-declared struct is **not visible outside its enclosing block**. Two functions may declare structs with the same name without collision.

---

## Pass 1 — Type Inference

**Modules:** `typeinference/mod.rs` (engine) + `typechecker/inference.rs` (AST walkers)

### Environment Structure

```
InferContext {
    mono_env: Vec<HashMap<String, (InferType, bool)>>  // scope stack, innermost last
    poly_env: Vec<HashMap<String, TypeScheme>>           // scope stack, mirrors mono_env
    constraints: Vec<Constraint>                        // accumulated equality constraints
    var_gen: TypeVarGenerator                           // globally unique TypeVar allocator
    registry: TypeDefinitionRegistry                    // pre-built struct/enum/method/aspect-impl registries
    current_return_type / current_break_type            // context for return/break inference
    current_type_params: HashMap<String, TypeVar>       // active generic param map (see below)
}
```

**`current_type_params` invariant:** set to the enclosing generic function's `name → TypeVar` map for the duration of `infer_fun_decl` / `infer_impl_method` body inference, and restored to the caller's map afterward via `swap_type_params`. Empty at top level and inside non-generic functions. All type annotations inside a function body (`let`, `var`, `for`-init, closure params) must resolve through `ann_to_infer(ann, ctx)` rather than the bare `type_expr_to_infer(ann)` so that param names resolve to their TypeVars instead of `Type::Named`.

`poly_env` takes precedence over `mono_env` in `ctx.lookup()`. Poly entries are automatically instantiated with fresh type variables on each lookup (let-polymorphism).

### Constraint Emission

Each `infer_expr` call returns an `InferType` and may push zero or more `Constraint`s into `ctx.constraints`. Constraints are not solved inline — they accumulate and are solved in batch.

### Inline Solve-and-Generalize (Functions)

`infer_fun_decl` solves accumulated constraints immediately after inferring the function body, generalizes the function type, and re-binds it as a `TypeScheme` in `poly_env`. This is essential for:
- Let-polymorphism: the function's type scheme can be instantiated fresh at each call site
- Mutual recursion: the pre-hoisted mono binding is unified with the inferred type before generalization

The same constraints remain in `ctx.constraints` after the inline solve; the final `ctx.solve()` at the top level re-solves the same list (idempotent).

### Eager Partial Solves

A few inference cases call `ctx.solve()` eagerly to determine structural type information before emitting further constraints:

- `Expr::ForIn`: resolves the iterable type to decide Array vs Range
- `Expr::FieldAccess`, `Expr::MethodCall`, `Expr::TupleAccess`: resolves the receiver type to look up fields/methods

These partial solves are read-only (they produce a `Substitution` value but don't modify `ctx.constraints`). They are a pragmatic workaround for the fact that field/method lookup requires knowing the concrete type name — a fundamental limitation of constraint-only inference.

### Incremental Constraint Solving (v0.8.2)

`InferContext::solve()` now caches the solved substitution for the already-seen
prefix of `ctx.constraints` and only processes newly appended constraints on the
next call. This is valid because inference only ever appends constraints; it
does not rewrite or remove earlier ones.

This matters because generic-heavy inference triggers many eager partial solves.
Re-solving the full constraint list on every call was the dominant cost in the
`0.8.2` benchmark baseline. The cache keeps the behavior the same while making
repeated solves proportional to the number of new constraints rather than the
entire accumulated list.

The invariant is:

- constraints are append-only during a typecheck run
- cached substitutions may be reused only for the already-solved prefix
- `default_literal_vars(...)` remains a caller-side post-processing step and is
  not stored in the cache

### Mutability Enforcement

Binding mutability is tracked as a boolean flag in `mono_env`: `HashMap<String, (InferType, bool)>`. `bind_mono(name, ty, is_mutable)` stores the flag. `lookup_for_write(name, span)` retrieves the binding and returns `T0006` if `is_mutable` is false.

Three write sites call `lookup_for_write` during Pass 1:

1. **Direct assignment** (`Expr::Assign { target: Ident(x), .. }`) — checked directly.
2. **`&var x`** (`UnaryOp::RefMut` where the operand is `Ident`) — checked before returning `MutPointer(T)`.
3. **Field assignment** (`Expr::FieldAssign`) — the object is inferred first to resolve its type. If the object type is `MutPointer(T)` (auto-deref field assign), the binding check is skipped entirely. Otherwise, `root_binding_for_write` walks the object chain (`FieldAccess → Index → Ident`) to find the root binding and calls `lookup_for_write` on it. Chains ending in `UnaryOp::Deref` also return `None` from `root_binding_for_write` and are exempt.

Method `self` parameters: `self` in an `&var self` method is bound with `is_mutable = true` regardless of the `Param::mutable` flag (which the parser always sets to `false` for receivers). This is handled at `infer_impl_method` and `infer_default_aspect_method` with `p.mutable || matches!(p.receiver, Some(ReceiverKind::RefMut))`.

### Type Ascription (`:` Operator)

`e : T` is a pure inference hint. Inference:
1. Infers the inner expression type `inner_ty`.
2. Converts the annotation `T` to an `InferType` via `type_expr_to_infer`.
3. Adds a constraint `inner_ty ~ ascribed_ty`.
4. Returns `inner_ty` (not the annotated type directly).

The constraint propagates the annotation into the solver without changing control flow. In Pass 2, the ascription node is **erased**: `construct_expr` resolves the annotation to a concrete `Type` and constructs the inner expression with that type as the expected-type hint. No `TypedExpr::Ascribe` variant exists — ascription has zero runtime cost.

---

## Pass 2 — Construction

**Modules:** `typechecker/construction.rs` and its `construction/` submodules

Pass 2 re-walks the untyped AST with:
- `subst: &Substitution` — the final solved substitution from Pass 1
- `scheme_env: &SchemeEnv` — generalized type schemes for user-defined functions
- `ResolvedInferenceFacts` — immutable concrete decisions made by Pass 1
- `ConstructCtx` — a stripped-down context with concrete `Type` values (no inference)

Construction uses the solved substitution to instantiate schemes and turn annotations
into concrete types, but does not receive mutable inference state. Decisions that Pass 1
must communicate are converted to `Type` while creating `ResolvedInferenceFacts`; for
example, an inferred closure return type is resolved once at this boundary and then
copied into the typed closure. Polymorphic closures intentionally have no single
concrete return fact: they are omitted and reconstructed per call site by the existing
generic-body path. This is the current interpreter compatibility path, not the intended
compiler boundary: frontend monomorphization must eventually replace
`FunBody::Generic` and `GenericClosure` bodies with concrete typed specializations
before evaluation or code generation. No constraints are emitted and the final
substitution is never mutated.

### Responsibility and retained overlap

Inference owns constraint generation, eager structural lookup needed to continue
inference, and closure return-type decisions. Construction owns typed-AST shape,
concrete call instantiation, coercion nodes, runtime method-dispatch metadata, pattern
bindings, and exhaustiveness diagnostics. Lowering is a pre-pass and does not infer or
construct typed nodes.

Some traversal overlap remains deliberately. Method calls are inspected during
inference to constrain receivers and arguments, then resolved against concrete types
during construction so the typed AST can carry dispatch metadata and inserted
coercions. Generic call schemes are likewise instantiated in both passes for different
outputs: constraints in Pass 1 and a monomorphic typed call in Pass 2. Removing this
overlap safely requires frontend monomorphization and a typed intermediate
representation that records complete call resolution, not exposing mutable inference
internals to construction. Bound
satisfaction itself remains centralized in the registry/type-inference queries rather
than being independently reimplemented by each traversal.

### Polymorphic Call Sites

When a call site resolves to a polymorphic callee (present in `scheme_env` but not in `ConstructCtx.env`), `construct_call` calls `instantiate_scheme_for_call`, which:
1. Instantiates the scheme with fresh type variables
2. Unifies the instantiated param types against the concrete argument types
3. Returns the concrete `Fun` type for the specific call

### Polymorphic Function Bodies

Functions with quantified type variables in their scheme are stored as `FunBody::Generic(untyped_block)` rather than `FunBody::Typed(typed_block)`. At each call site the evaluator re-runs the construction pass on the untyped block at the concrete call-site types, producing a `TypedBlock` that is evaluated normally. This is the monomorphization mechanism.

`let`-bound unannotated closures generalised to polymorphic schemes are stored as `TypedExpr::GenericClosure { params, body: Block, .. }` and evaluated to `ClosureBody::Untyped(block)`. The evaluator re-runs construction per call, mirroring the function case.

**An `ImplBlock` that declares its own generics (v0.10.0, issue #233 — `impl<T:
Bound> Aspect for Type<T>`, or the `where` form) defers its methods to
`FunBody::Generic` the same way**, in `construct_impl_method`: `is_generic_target`
is now `impl_has_generics || struct_generic_names_for(target_name)...`, so an impl
whose target isn't even a nominal struct/enum (RFC-0061's structural blanket impls,
e.g. `impl<T: Display> Display for T[]`) is also covered without needing a real
`target_name` to key a registry lookup on. `construct_default_aspect_methods` is
skipped entirely for these impls — it constructs default method bodies eagerly
against a concrete `self` type today, which isn't sound against a conditional or
structural target without knowing the instantiation. Real bound-satisfaction
checking at each instantiation is issue #241/#245's job, not this mechanism's;
this only makes the syntax construct without crashing.

**Generic type arguments aren't recoverable from a runtime `Value` on their own
(issue #267, ADR-0043).** `construct_generic_body` (called from
`evaluator/call.rs` when a `ClosureBody::Untyped` is invoked) unifies the
receiver/argument types derived from live `Value`s against the scheme's declared
types to build the substitution used to construct the body. `Value::Struct`/
`Value::Enum` carry no type-argument info of their own, so naively this
unification always failed on an arity mismatch for any generic struct/enum
receiver, silently defaulting the type parameter to `Unit`.
`typechecker::infer_named_type_args` fixes this by unifying each field's
*declared* type template (from the registry, `FieldEntry.ty`) against that
field's *actual* type (computed by the evaluator recursing over the live value)
and reading the type's own quantified type variables back out of the resulting
substitution — recovering, from field values alone, what the value's own type
tag never recorded. See ADR-0043 for the full reasoning and the rejected
alternative (tagging `Value` itself).

### Closure Body Expected Type

`Expr::Closure` construction passes `return_type.as_ref().map(|_| &ret_ty)` as the `expected_tail_ty` for `construct_block`. This is necessary so that enum variant literals with unmentioned type params (e.g. `Result::Ok { value }` in a `fun() -> Result<T,E>`) can resolve the unbound type argument from the annotation hint rather than failing with T0002. Closures without an explicit return annotation pass `None`.

### Exhaustive Match Checking

`check_match_exhaustiveness` runs at the end of `construct_match` once the scrutinee type is known concretely.

- An unguarded `_`, bare binding pattern, or irrefutable tuple `(a, b, ...)` is a catch-all — exhaustive.
- **Guarded arms do not count**: a guard may fail at runtime.
- `Bool`: must cover `true` and `false` (both unguarded).
- `Perhaps(_)`: must cover `Perhaps::Some` and `Perhaps::Nope`.
- `Result(_, _)`: must cover `Result::Ok` and `Result::Err`.
- Named enum: must cover every variant.
- `Never`: vacuously exhaustive.
- All other types (Int, Float, Str, …): value-infinite; only a catch-all satisfies exhaustiveness.

Error: `E0008 Non-exhaustive match`.

---

## Type Registries

All type and impl data is stored in a single `TypeDefinitionRegistry` (owned by `InferContext`, shared with `ConstructCtx` via reference). This replaced the previous design where four separate maps were passed to `ConstructCtx` individually (#133).

| Field | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `struct_env` | `HashMap<String, Vec<(String, InferType, Span)>>` | struct name → field list (name, type, declaration span) |
| `struct_type_params` | `HashMap<String, Vec<TypeVar>>` | generic struct name → ordered type-param TypeVars (absent for non-generic structs) |
| `method_env` | `HashMap<String, HashMap<String, InferType>>` | type name → method name → fun type |
| `enum_env` | `HashMap<String, EnumInfo>` | enum name → variant list + type params |
| `aspect_env` | `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` | aspect name → required method names |
| `impl_aspect_env` | `HashMap<(target, aspect), Vec<Vec<Type>>>` | aspect impl type-arg lists |

`TypeDefinitionRegistry` is constructed in one pre-pass and injected into `InferContext::new`, consistent with [ADR-0001](decisions/adr-0001-typeregistry-structure-and-location.md).

### Elaboration output: `TypedImplBlock::aspect_id`

`TypedImplBlock` carries `aspect_id: Option<SymbolId>` (v0.8.1, METEL-152). It is populated at the end of `construct_impl_decl` by:

1. Looking up the aspect's declaring module via `ctx.registry.aspect_declaring_module(aspect_name)`.
2. Looking up the `SymbolId` for `(declaring_module, aspect_name)` in `ctx.symbols` (the name resolver's intern table, threaded from `check_graph`).

`ctx.symbols` is `None` on the single-module pipeline (`check` / `check_with_ctx`), so `aspect_id` is `None` in that path. The elaborator (`elaborate`) consumes `aspect_id` and stores it in `RuntimeAspectImpl::aspect_id` for SymbolId-keyed dispatch.

## Coherence, Conditional Impls, Associated Types, and Structural Bounds (v0.10.0)

Five RFCs (0036, 0037, 0060's remaining scope, 0072, 0082, 0061) landed together this
sprint and share one pipeline shape: a bound-satisfaction question asked repeatedly
across the typechecker, resolved the same way everywhere it's asked.

### Coherence pass (`src/coherence.rs`)

Runs as its own stage between path normalization and typechecking (introduced in
#238, extended here). For every `impl`/`extend` block across the module graph it
checks, in order:

1. **Orphan rule (`T0014`)** — an impl is rejected unless the aspect or the target
   type is local to the declaring module. Structural type constructors (`T[]`,
   tuples, `fun` types) are treated as owned by `std::core`, never locally owned by
   a user module on their own (`outermost_id` returns `None` for them) — so a user
   module may only implement a *locally-declared* aspect for a structural target.
2. **Overlap detection (`T0015`)** — a pairwise scan across every impl of a given
   aspect (not exact-key grouping, since a blanket impl and a concrete impl for the
   same aspect never share a canonical key shape but can still conflict). Two impls
   are allowed to coexist when they're *provably disjoint*: one requires `T: Bound`
   and the other requires `T: !Bound` at the same target position (RFC-0036 §3.1
   syntactic negation). This positional bound extraction
   (`scoped_type_param_bounds`) and the `TypeParam(i)` canonicalization it depends
   on (`canonicalize_impl_target`) apply identically to `Named` targets and to
   structural targets (`T[]`'s element position, a tuple's element positions, a
   `fun` type's parameter/return positions) — RFC-0061 §2 requires structural
   targets to follow the same rules "without special cases," and the two functions
   are written to share one code path rather than special-casing shape.
3. **Polarity** — a negative impl (`extend Type: !Aspect;`) takes priority over a
   *blanket* positive impl for an overlapping instantiation (not a coherence
   conflict), but conflicts with a *concrete* positive impl for the exact same type
   (RFC-0081 §2.2) — decided by whether the positive side's canonical target still
   contains a `TypeParam`, not by polarity alone.

### Conditional-impl bound checking at use sites

`conditional_impl_bounds`/`array_impl_bounds` (and their negative-bound twins)
store each conditional impl's per-position bound requirements, keyed by aspect and
target. `type_satisfies_aspect` (`src/typeinference/mod.rs`) is the single
recursive query every use site funnels through: method calls, struct/enum literal
construction, and generic function-call bound checking (`check_type_satisfies_bounds`
in `src/typechecker/construction.rs`) all ask this same function rather than each
re-implementing bound satisfaction. For `Type::Array`, it recurses into the
element type through the same function — so `T[]: Display` is satisfied
recursively for `T[][]` without any special nested-array case.

### Associated types (RFC-0082)

An aspect's `type Name;` (or `type Name: Bound;`) declarations and an impl's
`type Name = Concrete;` definitions are stored alongside the aspect/impl
registries. `T::AssocType` projections are resolved to the concrete type at both
call sites and inside impl method bodies (not left as an opaque placeholder past
construction). Equality constraints (`Aspect<AssocType = Concrete>`) and impl
completeness (every declared associated type must be defined, `T0017` otherwise)
are checked at the same points ordinary bound satisfaction is.

### Opaque return types (RFC-0037)

`fun f() -> impl Aspect` carries a `TypeScheme.opaque_returns` entry rather than
exposing the concrete return type to callers. The concrete type is checked against
the declared bound at definition time (once, at the function's own construction);
callers only ever see the aspect's interface, enforced by rejecting any use of the
result that isn't sanctioned by the bound.

### Structural targets

`Type::Array`/`Type::Tuple`/`Type::Fun` never resolve to a `SymbolId` the way a
named type does, so they're handled as explicit match arms wherever bound
satisfaction or diagnostics are produced, rather than falling through a generic
`Type::Named` path. `check_type_satisfies_bounds` emits a distinct `T0012` hint per
shape: arrays name the element type that's missing the bound; tuples and
functions report the concrete type since neither has a real impl to point at yet
(RFC-0061 §6/§7).

## Known Limitations

### `as` Cast — Via `From<S>` Aspect (v0.4)

`as` is now desugared to a `From<S>` aspect check. Built-in impls cover `Int ↔ Float`. User-defined types may implement `From<S>` to enable `as` casts. Casting between types with no `From` impl is a typecheck error.

## Extension Points

### v0.4 — Aspects (shipped)

All four v0.4 extension points are done:

1. ~~Add `impl_env` / extend `TypeDefinitionRegistry` with aspect-impl storage~~ — **done**: `TypeDefinitionRegistry` carries `aspect_env: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` (aspect name → required method names) and `impl_aspect_env: HashMap<(target, aspect), Vec<Vec<Type>>>` (impl type-arg lists).
2. ~~Replace the provisional `as` cast with a `From<S>` aspect check~~ — **done**: `construct_cast` calls `has_from_impl(target, source)` and errors with `cannot cast` if no impl is registered.
3. ~~Replace the provisional `?` error type match with a `From<E>` coercion lookup~~ — **done**: `construction.rs` emits a `PropagateError` node carrying the `from_key` when `E1 ≠ E2`; the evaluator calls the impl at runtime.
4. ~~Upgrade `for-in` from Array/Range only to an `Iterable<T>` aspect check~~ — **done**: inference pass checks `iterable_elem_type` and falls back to Array/Range for built-in types.
